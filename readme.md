## 🌹 Wellington Botanical Gardens 🌹

### Intro 📁
This project came into fruition from the UX Research Project in which Mohnish Leuva, Ciaran Slow and I teamed up to create a prototype for the Wellington Botanical Gardens homepage.

### Redesigning the Homepage
The Wellington City Council has not updated the homepage for the Wellington Botanical Gardens for a long time, seeing as the JavaScript supporting the webpage is now outdated. Our team wanted to redesign and update the homepage so it would be more appealing and attract more people.

### Key Points 🔑
* Clear and responsive layout using BootStrap
* A fluid and clean slider that showcases the visual aspects of the Botanical Gardens
* CSS styling to help make the website stand out
